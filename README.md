# SimpleStorage Smart Contract

This is a simple smart contract written in Solidity that demonstrates basic storage and retrieval of data. The contract allows you to set and get a single unsigned integer value.

## Smart Contract Details

- **Contract Name:** SimpleStorage
- **Compiler Version:** Solidity 0.8.0
- **License:** MIT

## Functions

1. `set(uint256 _value)`
   - This function allows you to set a new unsigned integer value in the contract's storage.

2. `get() view returns (uint256)`
   - This function allows you to read and retrieve the currently stored unsigned integer value from the contract's storage.

## Usage

To use this smart contract, you can follow these steps:

1. Deploy the contract on an Ethereum blockchain, such as the Ethereum mainnet, testnet, or a local development environment.

2. Use a DApp (Decentralized Application) or Ethereum wallet to interact with the contract. You can call the `set` function to set a new value, and the `get` function to read the stored value.

## Example Interaction

Here's a simple example of how to interact with the contract using Remix (a Solidity IDE):

1. Copy the contract code from `SimpleStorage.sol`.

2. Open Remix at [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org).

3. Create a new file named `SimpleStorage.sol` and paste the contract code.

4. Compile and deploy the contract using Remix's development environment.

5. Interact with the contract by calling the `set` function to set a value and the `get` function to retrieve the stored value.
